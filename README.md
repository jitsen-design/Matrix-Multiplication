##Matrix Multiplication Projects

##1 Markhov Chain Problem

This Markhov Chain Problem is a textbook exercise, and I have demonstrated how you would use NumPy to carry out matrix-vector operations

##Rref Matrices

This problem is once again from a textbook exercise. In this exercise the linalg function in NumPy did not work as expected, so I used the sympy
symbolic notation library to carry out the reduced row matrix multiplication

You may download IPython Notebook and run the code through that, run the code through a Python IDE, or through the terminal. I have provided both ipynp and py formats.
